SourceForge [download statistics](https://sourceforge.net/projects/x3d/files/stats/timeline) are interesting.

## How To Do It

The Zip installation is most reliable and popular, typically working without modifications.

## Troubleshoot Netbeans

If things don't work "out of the box" for you, here are some further tips.

If you have an earlier X3D-Edit build installed earlier, please reinstall your zip.

NetBeans users troubleshooting certificate permissions can also download and install the following NetBeans plugin which provides end-user more positive control 
when certificate problems occur (such as automated quarterly updates).

* [ssl_certificate_exception-0.17.nbm](SSL Certificate Exception plugin) ([documentation](https://plugins.netbeans.apache.org/catalogue/?id=20)) while we currently use self-signed certificates.  This helps with automaticupdate capabilities.

[Changelog](https://sourceforge.net/p/x3d/code/HEAD/log/?path=/www.web3d.org/x3d/tools/X3dEdit4.0/X3dEditModuleSuite/README.prerelease.md) provides progress details.
