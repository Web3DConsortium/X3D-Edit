# X3D-Edit 4.0 Distribution, 20 June 2023

<!-- posted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/x3d/files -->

X3D-Edit is a free, open-source Extensible 3D (X3D) Graphics authoring tool for simple high-quality authoring, editing, import/export, validation and viewing of X3D scenes.

Prerequisite for operation: Java JDK 17 LTS (or later).  Suggested:

* Oracle  jdk-20.0.1, latest versions available at [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads)
* OpenJDK jdk-20.0.1, latest versions available at [https://openjdk.org](https://openjdk.org) (but likely have to setup PATH, CLASSPATH)

*Directions.* Download and extract the .zip, use file properties to unblock file if necessary,  unzip.
Then run appropriate operating-system binary in the <code>bin</code> directory.  Windows example:

* *[install directory]/x3deditmodulesuite\bin\x3deditmodulesuite64.exe* 

*User expectations.* Please note that this beta release is initially focused on restoring original X3D-Edit 3.3 functionality.
Once baseline stability is demonstrated on multiple platforms, we expect that further authoring support for 
[X3D4](https://www.web3d.org/x3d4) nodes and features will be added steadily.

[NetBeans 18](https://netbeans.apache.org) plugin tests satisfactory: use [X3D-Edit Update Center](https://savage.nps.edu/X3D-Edit/#Downloads) to simplify module updates once installed.

## How To Do It

The Zip installation is most reliable and popular, typically working without modifications.

## Troubleshooting the ZIP

If things don't work "out of the box" for you, here are some further tips.

If you have an X3D-Edit build installed earlier than 16 December 2022, please reinstall your zip.

Following installation, a modification might be needed to point to your locally installed Java JDK.
For example, under Windows the following file requires modification.

* Zip installation:  <br /><b><code>C:\downloads\x3deditmodulesuite\etc\x3deditmodulesuite.conf</code></b> (for example)

* Windows installer: <br /><b><code>C:\Program Files\x3deditmodules\etc\x3deditmodulesuite.conf</code></b> (for example)

... then look for <code><b>#</b>jdkhome="/path/to/jdk"</code> in that file and add the following, using your actual local path:

* <code>jdkhome="C:\Program Files\Java\openjdk\jdk-20.0.1"</code> (for example)

Note: if you use default installation directory, then you may need administrator permissions to perform any such modifications.

## TODO

* NetBeans-produced Windoes installers need a better solution that needs to bundle Java or else include a properly configured JDK CLASSPATH.
* We plan to setup a NetBeans plugin update capability that might work for all versions. Step by step...
