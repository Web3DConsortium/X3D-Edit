# X3D-Edit 4.0 Prerelease, 29 December 2023

<!-- posted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/x3d/files/X3D-Edit%20Pre-Release%20Testing/ -->

This directory shares pre-release test files prior to [official X3D-Edit applications release](https://sourceforge.net/projects/x3d/files).
Please see that README page for installation instruction details.

X3D-Edit software development has moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/Web3DConsortium/X3D-Edit) 
with primary software deployment occurring via [NetBeans X3D-Edit plugin](https://plugins.netbeans.apache.org/catalogue/?id=90) autoupdate support.
These SourceForge pages are used for distributing X3D-Edit application installers.

The following files are available for X3D-Edit installation and authoring:

SourceForge [download statistics](https://sourceforge.net/projects/x3d/files/stats/timeline) are interesting.

## How To Do It

The Zip installation is most reliable and popular, typically working without modifications.

## Source Code has Moved

Note: SourceForge is great!  Nevertheless we have moved source code development to [https://github.com/Web3dConsortium/X3D-Edit](https://github.com/Web3dConsortium/X3D-Edit) 
to conform with trusted-plugin requirements on the [Apache NetBeans Plugin Portal](https://plugins.netbeans.apache.org/catalogue/?id=90).

* Previous tests satisfactory: [X3D-Edit Update Center](https://savage.nps.edu/X3D-Edit/#Downloads) to simplify beta testing of module updates.

## Troubleshoot Netbeans

If things don't work "out of the box" for you, here are some further tips.

If you have an earlier X3D-Edit build installed earlier, please reinstall your zip.

NetBeans users troubleshooting certificate permissions can also download and install the following NetBeans plugin which provides end-user more positive control 
when certificate problems occur (such as automated quarterly updates).

* [ssl_certificate_exception-0.17.nbm](SSL Certificate Exception plugin) ([documentation](https://plugins.netbeans.apache.org/catalogue/?id=20)) while we currently use self-signed certificates.  This helps with automaticupdate capabilities.

[Changelog](https://sourceforge.net/p/x3d/code/HEAD/log/?path=/www.web3d.org/x3d/tools/X3dEdit4.0/X3dEditModuleSuite/README.prerelease.md) provides progress details.
Test reports and feedback welcome.  Please send email to
